Enzyme
Copyright (c)2011 - Adam Leggett

-------------------------------------------

Enzyme is a C++ framework for accessing hardware features from
user mode applications on Windows and Linux, with the possibility
of additional future ports or even support for hardware emulation.
Enzyme is intended to be flexible enough to be the basis for a
user mode hardware driver on any OS.

It is currently experimental, and this code does not even build
yet.

The design goals:

-	Easy to use API; simple use cases should be simple to write.

-	Flexibility to support complex use cases.

-	Portability to any OS supporting an ANSI C++ compiler with STL.

-	Small overhead; high performance; minimal stack depth.

-	No kernel module required for recent Linux versions.

This project was inspired by Yariv Kaplan's WinIo library, which
